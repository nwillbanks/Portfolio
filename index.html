      <p>
          My name is Nick Willbanks.  I am an aspiring developer with a passion for business and user experience.  I'm currently attending bootcamp through the Trinity program at the University of Minnesota.  My hobbies include camping at Mille Lacs lake in Minnesota, hosting karaoke, and spending lax weekend afternoons with my wife and dog watching Netflix (gaming when she lets me).

          Please check out some of the apps that I've developed, and give your feedback.  While it's always great to get a compliment, constructive criticism is always more...well...constructive.

          Thanks!
